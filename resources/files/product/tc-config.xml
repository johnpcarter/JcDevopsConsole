    This is the default Terracotta server configuration file for the Terracotta kit.
    It defines a single off-heap resource of 512MB to be used for storing data.
    It defines a single directory for the server to put its data.
    It also defines a single server, but you can add another one to benefit from high availability.

    Please note that this is a per-stripe configuration, and most of the configuration elements
    need to match across stripes.
